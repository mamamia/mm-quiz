            To all the Shade Queens out there: we see you and we feel your pain.
            Summer isn’t your favourite season, so you’re the one sitting in full
            shade covered in a towel, sunnies and a massive hat while your mates
            lounge in the sun. You might even wear a chic driving glove to keep
            your driving hand from seeing the sun. (OK, you probably don’t wear a
            driving glove…) Shade Queens love the social aspect of summer, just
            not the bit where you have to sit in the sun getting all sweaty, itchy
            and hot and bothered.

            Summer to you means one thing above all else. PARTY TIME! Some people
            get exhausted by the endless summer party invites, but not you. You
            live for it. You say YES to all the after work drinks, backyard
            barbies, house parties, beach picnics and Sunday sessions. You get
            your energy from having your favourite people around you and will
            rarely turn down a chance to catch up. In other words, Daylight
            Savings is your jam. Bring on long summer days and balmy summer
            nights.
