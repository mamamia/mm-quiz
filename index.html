            Summer isn’t your favourite season, so you’re the one sitting in full
            shade covered in a towel, sunnies and a massive hat while your mates
            lounge in the sun. You might even wear a chic driving glove to keep
            your driving hand from seeing the sun. (OK, you probably don’t wear a
            driving glove…) Shade Queens love the social aspect of summer, just
            not the bit where you have to sit in the sun getting all sweaty, itchy
            and hot and bothered.
