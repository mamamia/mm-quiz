          To all the Shade Queens out there: we see you and we feel your pain.
          Summer isn’t your favourite season, so you’re the one sitting in full
          shade covered in a towel, sunnies and a massive hat while your mates
          lounge in the sun. You might even wear a chic driving glove to keep
          your driving hand from seeing the sun. (OK, you probably don’t wear a
          driving glove…) Shade Queens love the social aspect of summer, just
          not the bit where you have to sit in the sun getting all sweaty, itchy
          and hot and bothered.
